About myself
------------

Hello everybody,

my name is Kamil and I'm embedded systems and wireless sensor networkenthusiast.
Especially I'm interested in those Linux and/or RTOS powered. During my free time I tend to
play with them a little ;).

I've decided to to share some of my work and my passion, so I'm starting this online notebook.


About this site
---------------

I'm treating this site as my hobby, so expect changes. The code is shared on my github
account. For now, I'm using the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) framework to build it.
